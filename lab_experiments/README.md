## 🔧 1. Setting Up the Environment & Data Preprocessing  
Set up the complete ML environment 🧰, handled missing values, encoded categorical data, scaled features, and split the dataset for training and testing.  

## ⚙️ 2. SVM & Random Forest for Classification  
Built Support Vector Machine and Random Forest models 🌿 to handle both binary and multiclass classification. Evaluated results using accuracy and confusion matrices.  

## 🌳 3. Classification with Decision Trees  
Constructed Decision Tree classifiers 🌲 to visualize branching decisions and understand how features affect outputs.  

## 🧩 4A. Support Vector Machines (SVM)  
Implemented various kernel types 🧮 (linear, RBF, polynomial) and visualized classification margins for optimal model separation.  

## 🌲 4B. Ensemble Learning – Random Forest  
Explored ensemble learning 🌳 combining multiple decision trees to reduce variance and improve classification stability.  

## 🔍 5. Clustering with K‑Means & PCA  
Applied unsupervised learning using K‑Means 🔢 for clustering and Principal Component Analysis 📉 for dimensionality reduction and visualization.  

## 🧬 6. Feedforward & Convolutional Neural Networks  
Developed Feedforward and CNN architectures 🧠 for image and data classification, comparing performance across model types.  

## 🎨 7. Generative Models with GANs  
Trained a Generative Adversarial Network 🎭 to generate realistic images by balancing generator and discriminator networks.  

## ⚡ 8. Model Evaluation & Hyperparameter Tuning  
Performed model optimization using Grid Search and Cross‑Validation 🔁 to improve generalization and accuracy.  

## 🚀 9. Model Deployment with Flask & Docker  
Deployed ML models 🌐 through Flask REST APIs and containerized them with Docker 🐳 for consistent and scalable deployment.
